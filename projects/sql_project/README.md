# SQL Project: Retail Sales & Customer Insights

## Overview
This SQL project analyzes a fictional retail business to answer practical business questions:
- Which products and categories generate the highest revenue?
- Which customers are the most valuable?
- How do monthly sales and order volume trend over time?

The project includes schema creation, sample data inserts, and analytical queries using joins, aggregations, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs).

## Files
- `retail_sales_analysis.sql`: End-to-end SQL script (DDL + DML + analysis queries).

## Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Data modeling with relational tables and foreign keys.
- Multi-table joins and aggregation.
- Time-based trend analysis (`DATE_TRUNC`).
- Ranking with window functions (`RANK`).
- Customer segmentation based on revenue contribution.

## How to Run
1. Open PostgreSQL (or a compatible SQL environment).
2. Run the script in this order:
   - table creation
   - sample inserts
   - analysis queries
3. Review query outputs for insights and business recommendations.

## Example Insights You Can Derive
- Top products by revenue and quantity sold.
- Customer lifetime value ranking.
- Monthly revenue and average order value trends.
- Category-level performance split.
